/*
The flyweight factory will be used by client programs to instantiate the Object, so we need to keep a map of Objects
in the factory that should not be accessible by client application.

Whenever client program makes a call to get an instance of Object, it should be returned from the HashMap, if not
found then create a new Object and put in the Map and then return it. We need to make sure that all the intrinsic
properties are considered while creating the Object.

Notice the use of Java Enum for type safety, Java Composition (shapes map) and Factory pattern in getShape method.
